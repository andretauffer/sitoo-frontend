This is a single page application designed for the sitoo front-end test by me (André Girão Tauffer).

## Available Scripts

In the project root directory, you can run:

### `npm run client`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### `npm run server`

Runs the server in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088) to make requests in the browser or do it via postman.

### `Create Mock Users`

Not really a npm script, but a button that is left commented out on line 108 of UserManagement.js
It's sole purpose is generating mock data to test the design.
